# Single Page Website built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) ([SPICED Academy](https://www.spiced-academy.com/) project)

About the goal of this project:

> (...) You get to decide what you work on but there are a few guidelines you must follow.

> Your project must be substantial - you want to end up with something you can proudly demo on graduation day and thereafter, a fitting capstone to your time at SPICED.

> Your project must also be achievable. You do not want to end the week with little more than a good idea.

> It is ok if your project is just the first phase of a much larger project that could not possibly be achieved in one week, but it still must be a coherent and presentable piece of work on its own.

> This project is an opportunity to show what you have learned but it is also an opportunity to learn new things. It is expected that you will use things that we covered in class but you are welcome to try things with which you have no experience, provided that it seems reasonably certain that you will be able to accomplish your project's goals.
