# Kora Winter - "Bitter"

###### Please note this is a work in progress website and documentation, so content and appearance will change during time.

## 1. Introduction 👋

This website was build with a JavaScript library called [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [the code for the parallax scrolling experience](https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/demo3/) was originally written by Keith Clark. His code was heavily customized for this project to meet the vision I had in mind.

Kora Winter is a metal band from Germany and this website accompanies the release of their album release on September 13th 2019 called "Bitter".
