# Kora Winter - "Bitter"

This website was build with a JavaScript library called [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [the code for the parallax scrolling experience](https://keithclark.co.uk/articles/pure-css-parallax-websites/demo3/) was originally written by Keith Clark. 

His code was heavily customized for this project to meet the vision I had in mind.

Kora Winter is a metal band from Germany and this website accompanies the September 13th 2019 release of their album "Bitter".
